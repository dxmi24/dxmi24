- Hi, I’m @dxmi24, 21 years old, french, university student.

- I’m interested in a lot of things, but have no particularay interest in one thing. I just want to have a peaceful and chill life.

- I’m currently learning Python. I was a CS student for 2 years but I didn't pass the 3rd year. 
I'm now an Economic Student but I still want to improve in CS field. I'm just here to be better than I was during these past year.
I was not a very good student and I want to learn again but in a self-taught way now.

-  How to reach me : my email = dxmi25.prof@outlook.fr 

Thanks for reading me.
